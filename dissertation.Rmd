<!-- NOTES: 

1. All template code for formatting based on work from https://github.com/jvcasill/ua_thesis_rmd. The original .cls file is from https://github.com/mmalahe/unc-dissertation

2. Be careful of unicode characters, especially in the bibliography file. Very hard to find and can kick up errors that prevents the file from compiling. For example, a Wright reference had a U+2AB unicode character after children (an apostrophe) that was not recognized and kept the program from compiling. or 'Package inputenc Error: Unicode char Î± (U+3B1)', which was actually in a journal title in the .bib file. Dashes are also problematic. See header-unc.tex to avoid that problem and add characters with 'declareunicodecharacters'.

One way around this is to save the google doc file as a .txt file (ansi coding) then convert to utf-8 after opening in R (File|reopen with encoding)
